# First-repo
First creation of repo

Added Step_6 to repo and new text here under that branch.  Want to check the git command git push -u.

Still have to use the --set-upstream full command or the git push --all.  Created Step_7 now, adding the text.
Removed the pic files in the folders and added PDF's instead.
